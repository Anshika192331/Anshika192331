Q-Suppose You are having 13 playing cards of Heart and among these card you have to pick n
cards in sorted order. Your task is to pick another card from the remaining and insert it in
proper position of the previously sorted array
example if you have picked 5 cards in sorted order 4 6 8 9 12 and then you pick next card 7
you have to insert the card 7 in its sorted position.
Ans-#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int *p;
int n;
cin>>n;
p=new int[n+1];
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
cin>>p[i];
}
int x;
cin>>x;
int y;
for (int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
if (p[i] < x) {
y = (i+1);
break;
}
else {
y = 0;
}
}
for(int i=n-1;i>=y;i--){
p[i+1]=p[i];// shifting right side
}
p[y]=x;
for(int i=0;i<n+1;i++){
cout<<p[i]<<" ";
}
}
