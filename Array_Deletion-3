Q-Lewis is working on a game designing project called as Ball Blast and he is facing issue in
implementing the logic for the same. There are N number of balls having a number written
on each ball. All the balls are arranged in a row and as per the rules of the game, if there are
3 balls in a row having ODD number on them then the first ball of the set will be removed. 
The same process is to be repeated for all the balls from left to right. At the end of the game,
the numbers on the remaining ball is to be printed.

#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int n,*ae;
void del(int temp)
{
int i;
for(i = temp;i<n;i++)
{
ae[i] = ae[i+1];
}
}
void check()
{
bool key = false;
int temp,i;
for(i = 0;i<n-2;i++)
{
if(ae[i] % 2 != 0 && ae[i+1] % 2 != 0 && ae[i+2] % 2 != 0)
{
temp = i;
key = true;
break;
}
}
if(key == true)
{
del(temp);
n--;
check();
}
else return;
}

int i;

ae = new int[n];
for(i = 0;i<n;i++)
{
cin >> ae[i];
}
check();
for(i = 0;i<n;i++)
{
cout<<ae[i]<<" ";
