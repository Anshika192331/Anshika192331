Q-An IT company named as Cloudo_Tech is maintaining the records of its employees using a
linked list where the following details of employees are maintained:
1. Name
2. Employee ID
3. Salary
The company management is looking for an interface where they can search the details of
any employee using the Employee ID. You have to implement the solution for the same in
the following function:
void search_employee(int emp_id)
Ans-#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
struct Employee
{
string emp_name;
int salary;
int emp_id;
Employee *next;
};
Employee *Cloudo_Tech = NULL;
void add_employee()
{
//Creating Employee
Employee *emp = new Employee;
cin>>emp->emp_name;
cin>>emp->emp_id;
cin>>emp->salary;
//Inserting Employee in the beginning of the list
emp->next = Cloudo_Tech;
Cloudo_Tech = emp;
}
void search_employee(int id)
{
Employee *p= Cloudo_Tech;
int yes=0;
while(p!=NULL){
if(p->emp_id == id){
cout<<p->emp_name<<" "<<p->salary;
yes=1;
}
p=p->next;
}
if(yes==0){
cout<<"Employee does not exist";
}
}
int main() {
/* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */
int n;
cin>>n; //Reading number of employees
for(int i=0; i<n; i++) //adding employees in the list
add_employee();
int item;
cin>>item;
search_employee(item);
return 0;
}
