Q-Akash got a new coin game. In the coin game, Akash will only win the game if the total count
is 56. Each coin will have value inscribed. Write a programming solution, to help Akash in
counting total value of coins at the end of the game. Coin Game is played N times. ï‚·
Note: Player will have exactly K coin at the end of the game.
Ans-#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main() {
int i,n;
cin>>n;
int a[7];
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
int sum=0;
for(int j=0;j<7;j++)
{
cin>>a[j];
sum=sum+a[j];
}
if(sum==56)
cout<<1<<endl;
else
cout<<0<<endl;
}
}
