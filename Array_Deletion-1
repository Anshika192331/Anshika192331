Q2-During the get together party, Liza asked all her friends to play a game where all the N
friends have been asked to arrange themselves in a row and assigned some unique number. As per the rule of the game, Liza will show a number and the friend with that number needs
to get out of the row and the vacant space should be occupied by all the friends on the right
side such that the sequence is not disturbed. 
Example: If there are 5 friends with the numbers 4, 8, 3, 6, 2 and Liza has shown the number 8 then
the remaining friends should have the numbers: 4, 3, 6, and 2.
