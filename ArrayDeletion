Q5-Today is such a beautiful evening after heavy rainfall and kids decided to play in playground, then at the same moment they are deligthed to see the colors of Rainbow in the sky. They
observe seven colors like Violet, Indigo,Blue,Green,Yellow,Orange,Red i.e
'V','I','B','G','Y','O','R'.Now your task is to remove a color which is mentioned above as input
and display the remaining colors of Rainbow, if the color which you want to delete that is
not comes under VIBGYOR then display message as "Color not available".
Ans 5-#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
char arr[7]={'V','I','B','G','Y','O','R'},elem;
int tot=7, i, j, found=0;
cin>>elem;
for(i=0; i<tot; i++)
{
if(arr[i]==elem)
{
for(j=i; j<(tot-1); j++)
arr[j] = arr[j+1];
found++;
i--;
tot--;
}
}
if(found==0)
cout<<"Color not available";
else
for(i=0; i<tot; i++)
cout<<arr[i]<<"";
cout<<endl;
return 0;
}
