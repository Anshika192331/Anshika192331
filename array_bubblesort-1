Q-In a sports event, Lindsey, a famous athlete, has decided to meet her fans and shake hands
with them. The order in which she will meet them is the fan degree. i.e. the fan with
maximum degree will be considered first. Now, the fans are required to take positions
according to the degree value. While they are not allowed to swap positions with any other
person, but with the person at their adjacent places. Write a program to implement the
same.
Ans-#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void swap(int* xp, int* yp)
{
int temp = *xp; *xp = *yp; *yp = temp;
}
// A function to implement bubble sort
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
int i, j;
for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
// Last i elements are already in place
for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
if (arr[j] < arr[j + 1])
swap(&arr[j], &arr[j + 1]);
}
/* Function to print an array */
void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
int i;
for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
printf("%d ", arr[i]);
printf("\n");
}
// Driver program to test above functions
int main()
{
int arr[] = {4,10,6,9,5,1,8,2,7,3};
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
bubbleSort(arr, n);
printArray(arr, n);
return 0;
}
