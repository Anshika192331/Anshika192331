Q9-Consider a physical trainer is arranging the students for physical training in a school. There
are N students standing in a row for physical training. He wants to insert a student with
average height between the two students who are having odd height standing in
consecutive. Write a program for a physical trainer so that he can get the desired sequence
of students. Example: if the 5 students are having values: 3 6 5 9 7 then 5 and 9 are the students with
odd height so the student with height 7 (average of 5 and 9) should be inserted between 5
and 9. Similarly, 9 and 7 are the 2 students with odd heights so student with height 8 should
be inserted between 9 and 7. Output: 3 6 7 9 8 7

}
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
if(arr[i] == 0){
valid = 0;
}
}
if(n==1 || valid == 0){
cout<<"Invalid Input";
return 0;
}
for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
if(arr[i-1]%2!=0 && arr[i]%2!=0){
average = (arr[i-1]+arr[i])/2;
for(int j=n-1;j>=i;j--){
arr[j+1] = arr[j];
}
arr[i] = average;
i++;
n++;
}
}
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
}
return 0;
}
